      A software I personally used that I thought was designed well was Brave. It is a browser which is 
      privacy focused.  Brave blocks ads, trackers, and cookies right out of the box, so you’re not constantly 
      worrying about who's watching you. It is noticeably faster than chrome or edge because it blocks ads which
      lowers the load on the website. The interface of the software is pretty clean and intuitive. Nothing feels
      complicated or confusing. It offers simplicity and is easy to use. I have it as my default browser due to 
      these reasons. Because of its client-side encryption, it's also one of the few browsers that synchronizes 
      across devices without jeopardizing privacy. All things considered, Brave isn't just a beautifully designed
      browser; it feels as though it was created with actual people in mind, giving privacy, speed, and user 
      control priorities that the majority of other browsers just can't match.

      I feel like software design is useful as it diretly affects the user's usage of it.  You can take Brave, 
      google maps or spotify for example. These softwares are designed in a way that  even a normal person can use 
      it. A good software design should have no complexity in it. It should be pretty straightforward to use. It 
      also contributes to software performance by organizing how different  components work together, which can reduce
      bugs and improve speed. Additionally, design is the first impression a user has of the software. If a software 
      is poorly designed it will drive away users evem if it is a very good idea. In summary, software design affects 
      usability, functionality, performance  and long-term success. Without thoughtful design, even the most powerful 
      software can fail to meet user needs or achieve high user usabality.

  Requirements gathering is one of the most vital stage in software development. The develepors meet up with the stakeholders
  and understand their needs and expectations. It identifies all the functional requirements such as performance or security
  We gather our requirements using interviews or surveys. We need to document all the requirements of the program(SRS).
  It is important because it will help the stakeholders meet their expectations. And in a way it would reduce risk of
  project failure as we would know we are on the right path. It will save time and resources. It will also improve 
  communication with the stakeholders by understanding their requirements. Requirement gathering basically sets us up
  for a sucessful project. Gathering requirements through methods such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation 
  helps the team gather both explicit needs and implicit insights. It also provides opportunities to ask questions, 
  clarify details, and avoid miscommunication. Software developments is basically nothing without the requirements 
  gathering process. You will have a higher chance of a better software.

    As a privacy user, I want to block ads and trackers by default, so that my browsing experience remains private 
    and faster without intrusive ads.
    
    As a developer, I want to use Brave’s developer tools, so that I can debug and test my websites or applications within a
    privacy-respecting environment.

    As a user, I want to sync my bookmarks and browsing history across multiple devices, so that I can maintain a consistent
    browsing experience whether on desktop or mobile.

    As a user, I want to view and manage my browsing statistics (like blocked ads and trackers), so that I can see how Brave 
    is enhancing my browsing experience by protecting my privacy.      

    As a user, I want to clear all cookies and site data with one click, so that I can easily maintain my privacy and prevent sites
    from tracking me over time.
